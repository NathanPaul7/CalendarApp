##Project MVP

User click on the 'Create New Event' button wich opens a form with fields for entering date, time and event description. User clicks submit button which allows the new event to be listed in the 'Scheduled Events' section. User may click on the 'x' near a listed event in order to delete an event. User may click on 'Edit Event' button in order to edit details for a specific event. 

##Contributors

Jason Humphreys and this article: https://themeteorchef.com/tutorials/click-to-edit-fields-in-react helped me with figuring out how my conditional rendering methods would work. J Silverstein helped me understand the bootstrap grid. 

##Possible Future Editions

I would like to have weather data display for the date of a scheduled event. I would also like to use the google map API to allow a user to map the location of their scheduled event.
